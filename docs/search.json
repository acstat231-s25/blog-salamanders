    "text": "The following word clouds portray word frequencies for Rock, Dance, and Slow music genres. Our dataset had numerous genres, however Rock, Dance, and Slow were the three genres with most songs, thus they were chosen to be represented in the word clouds. The Rock genre is divided into four decades, namely the 1970’s through the 2000’s. Likewise, the Dance genre is divided into three decades, specifically the 1960’s through the 1980’s. One cumulative word cloud is displayed for the Slow genre, representing various decades in a cohesive manner.\n\nRock Genre by Decade\n\n1970’s1980’s1990’s2000’s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Figure 1, “time” and “lord” are two of the most common words in the 70’s for the Rock genre, representing people’s faith and desires for future change. Numerous anti-war protests, women’s liberation acts, civil rights movements, etc. occurred during this decade, alluding to the aforementioned terms having higher frequencies in song lyrics. The terms “love” and “baby” are emphasized in Figure 2, supporting the fact that this decade produced countless unforgettable love songs, including “Should I Stay or Should I Go” by The Clash, “With or Without You” by U2, “Love Shack” by The B-52’s. Figure 3 highlights the term “running,” symbolizing escape, freedom, and restlessness. The 90’s encountered rebellion and unease, thus themes of escaping were common. Figure 4 displays “life” and “lust” as having the highest word frequencies in Rock songs from this decade, which is sensible given that Indie rock was born in the early 2000’s, bringing with it themes of independence and authenticity. The Rock genre overall conveys strong ideas of love as well as a representation of the societal/musical changes and movements that occurred during each decade.\n\n\nDance Genre by Decade\n\n1960’s1970’s1980’s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, the Dance word clouds portrays word frequencies within the genre across each of the following decades: 1960’s, 1970’s, and 1980’s. Figure 5 shows “baby,” “love,” and “chain” as the words with higher frequencies in the Dance genre during the 60’s, which is supported by the fact that love was one of the more popular themes in 1960’s music. According to Figure 6, “funk” and “light” had high word frequencies is the Dance music genre, given that funk and rhythm were popular in the 1970’s. Figure 7 demonstrates “beat” and “call” as words of higher frequencies in the 80’s decade of Dance music, which aligns with the fact that telephones popularity skyrocketed during these years, including landlines, answering machines, and payphones. The term “call” became a term of love with these newfound methods of communication. Love, attachment, and funk are words of high frequency in the cumulative Dance genre (all three decades combined), and each decade had words of higher frequencies that were associated with popular themes during each of those years, such as the boogie and funk.\n\n\nSlow Genre\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, according to Figure 8, the Slow genre displays “love” and “baby” as the terms with higher frequencies, supported by the alignment of these terms with the emotional themes of Slow music. Love is an incredibly popular theme of slower songs, especially due to the intimacy and deep expression for which slow tempos allow. “Baby” is often used in these songs to refer to loved ones.\nEach of the three genres differ in terms of the themes conveyed by their most frequent words, however love is a commonly represented notion. Furthermore, the isolation of various decades within the Rock and Dance genres highlights the relationship between the societal and musical movements that occurred and the words of highest frequency in song lyrics written during those years. Despite any commonly embodied themes across the three genres, each genre still exhibited unique concepts. The Rock genre as a whole conveys key concepts of love and expression. The Dance genre cumulatively represents energy and rhythm, and lastly the Slow genre conveys emotion and steady paces."

    "text": "The famous, sometimes infamous, Rolling Stone magazine published its very first issue on November 9th, 1967. On the cover of the first volume of the magazine, John Lennon—one of four British Beatles—appears in a still shot from his role in the film How I Won the War.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Rolling Stone magazine’s first ever issue\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the first Top 500 list was not released until 2003, Rolling Stone has set the tone for music journalism from their first issue to this very moment.\n\n\nLet’s take a look at how the decades shape up compared to one another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The above segmented bar chart shows the distribution across decades of Rolling Stone Magazine’s Top 500 Songs of All Time from 2013. The colors of the segments show where on the list to find songs from a particular decade.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove, Figure 2 shows the distribution of the decades represented in Rolling Stone Magazine’s Top 500 Songs of All Time. In this, we can see that the 1960s are the clear leader in terms of representation on the list. In fact, roughly 35% of the songs on the list are from the 60s. The 70s follow at around 25%, and the 50s, 80s, and 90s each represent around 10-13% of the list. For more information on this breakdown, see Table 1. There is a clear trend downward from the 60s to the 2000s, with the 2000s being the least represented decade.\nTaking a closer look at where the songs fall in the ranking categories, i.e., Top 100, 200s, and so on, we can see that the 1960s have the most songs in the top 100 among all decades. However, this likely follows from 60s songs’ representation in the list. Interestingly, even though the 70s have many more songs on the list than the 50s, the 50s have slightly more songs in the Top 100.\n\n\nWhile all the artists on this list are well-deserving of their flowers, there are three artists who stand out among the rest. Combined, these three artists make up nearly 10% (Table 2) of the songs on the list. These artists are, of course, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and Bob Dylan.\n\nTop ArtistsTop Sentiments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The segmented bar chart above shows the number of songs each of the top three most represented artists has on the list. The segments show the decade of release of these artists’ songs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Top Artist Sentiments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor music lovers and Rolling Stone Magazine subscription-holders, it will come as little surprise that the top 3 artists represented in Rolling Stone’s Top 500 are, in order, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and Bob Dylan. The Top Artists chart above demonstrates the margin by which The Beatles’ songs outnumber the other two. The Beatles have a stunning 23 songs on the list—24 if you include John Lennon’s Imagine. The top ranking song from the supergroup is Hey Jude which ranks at 8 on the list. The Rolling Stones follow The Beatles with 14 songs, their first on the list, Satisfaction, at slot 2. Finally, Bob Dylan’s first feature of his 12 total on the list takes the number 1 slot, and that song is Like a Rolling Stone.\nWith the magazine, top artists and, songs in mind, you may have noticed a theme among their names. The number one song on the chart, one of the top three artists, and the magazine itself all contain some form of the words “Rollin’ Stone.” The is no coincidence, the band The Rolling Stones, who debuted in 1962, and Bob Dylan’s song Like a Rolling Stone (1965) are both named for the Muddy Waters song Rollin’ Stone (1950) which is actually among the top 500, ranking in at a surprising 459. The magazine is, with the additional influence of the proverb “a rolling stone gathers no moss,” named for all three of these astounding feats in music history.\nThe songwriting duo in the Beatles, John Lennon and Paul McCartney, known together as Lennon-McCartney wrote many hit songs in the 1960s (Figure 3). Though the songs they wrote for the Beatles were almost always credited to both the young gentlemen, songs written by Paul McCartney were notably more positive. Looking at Figure 4, we can see that the Beatles songs in the Top 500 tended to have a more positive sentiment, 0.83 on the AFINN’s -5 to 5 scale. For reference, Bob Dylan’s average song sentiment is around 0.035 and The Rolling Stones around -0.22. This coupled with the fact that the highest ranking Beatles song on the list is Hey Jude—a song written by Paul McCartney for Julian Lennon, John’s son—suggests that Paul McCartney might be the primary songwriter for more of the songs on the list than John Lennon.\n\n\n\nThe following tables are here to support your understanding of the above analyses and substantiate the numbers, percentages, and claims made in the text.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Decades\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSongs on List by Decade\n\n\nDecade\n\nMetrics\n\n\n\nCount\nPercent\n\n\n\n\n1950s\n55\n11.0\n\n\n1960s\n174\n34.8\n\n\n1970s\n123\n24.6\n\n\n1980s\n66\n13.2\n\n\n1990s\n54\n10.8\n\n\n2000s\n28\n5.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the Title implies, this supplemental Table 1 breaks down the number of songs the percentage of the total songs each decade holds.\n~~~~\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Artists\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSongs on List by Artist\n\n\nArtist\n\nMetrics\n\n\n\nCount\nPercent\n\n\n\n\nBob Dylan\n12\n2.4\n\n\nThe Beatles\n23\n4.6\n\n\nThe Rolling Stones\n14\n2.8\n\n\nTotal\n49\n9.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n~~~\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Top Ten\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      The Top Ten\n    \n    \n    \n      Rank\n      \n        Song Identifier\n      \n      \n        Release\n      \n    \n    \n      Artist\n      Title\n      Year\n      Decade\n    \n  \n  \n    1\nBob Dylan\nLike a Rolling Stone\n1965\n1960s\n    2\nThe Rolling Stones\nSatisfaction\n1985\n1980s\n    3\nJohn Lennon\nImagine\n1971\n1970s\n    4\nMarvin Gaye\nWhat's Going On\n1971\n1970s\n    5\nAretha Franklin\nRespect\n1967\n1960s\n    6\nThe Beach Boys\nGood Vibrations\n1966\n1960s\n    7\nChuck Berry\nJohnny B.

For example, words like accomplished have an AFINN value of 2, while words like abandoned have an AFINN value of -2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown above, we created two visualizations to explore the average sentiment of song lyrics by year and by genre. Hovering over a data point or bar reveals additional information about them, such as the average time, average bpm, and number of songs included in its year/genre.\nThe line chart for the average sentiment of song lyrics of 483 out of the top 500 best songs list by year demonstrates the overall trends in sentiment from the 1950s to 2000s. We can see that words in song lyrics generally expressed positive sentiment, as 49 out of the 53 years had average sentiment scores greater than zero. The plot does reveal some interesting patterns that might help contextualize the shifts in artistic expression over time and the emotional climate of different years. The trend line for average sentiment seems to be slightly downward sloping over time, which can be due to many factors. For example, music genres such as heavy metal, rock, and rap have been popularized in recent times, and these genres tend to include more words with negative sentiments than other genres. Additionally, the decrease in average sentiment could have been influenced by major events that occurred in specific years. For example, the average sentiment in 2005 was slightly negative (-0.04), which could be due to the fact that Hurricane Katrina hit the United States this year, causing significant damage to the U.S. economy and costing many lives. However, it should be noted that the trend line displayed on the line chart could be skewed and biased, as the many of the points for the later years do not have many songs to use as data. Thus, the decrease in average sentiment likely does not reflect the true nature of the change in sentiment of lyrics over time.\nThe bar chart for the average sentiment of song lyrics of 483 out of the top 500 best songs list by genre demonstrates the differences in overall sentiment between different genres of music. We can see that genres like dance, disco, and easy generally had the most positive average sentiment scores. This reflects the positive, energetic, and uplifting natures of lyrics used in these genres. On the other hand, genres like Reggae and Slow had negative sentiment scores, which makes sense as songs in these genres often evoke more solemn emotions such as calmness, peace, and melancholy. For rock music, the plot reveals that rock songs in different decades had varying average sentiments. Rock songs in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1980s had lyrics with very positive sentiments (around 0.8), while those in the 1970s and 2000s had pretty low average sentiments. That being said, only one rock song from the 2000s was included on the top 500 best songs list, so that bar does not reflect the actual average sentiment of rock songs in the 2000s.\n\n\n\n\nSentiment versus Song TimeSentiment versus BPM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two scatterplots above demonstrate the relationship between sentiment and two variables: song time and beats per minute (bpm). The points (songs) are also colored by their respective genres. Just like the previous plots, hovering over a data point or bar provides a dropdown with more information about the song, such as its title and artist.\nThe plot for average sentiment versus song time reveals that there is not a well-defined relationship between the two variables. The trend line is generally slightly negatively sloped, which could be an indicator that average sentiment decreases as song time increases. However, this is a very weak relationship that is likely skewed by the few very long songs (over 600 seconds) that have relatively low average sentiments. Thus, it doesn’t seem like song time is a good predictor of average sentiment.\nThe second scatterplot also reveals that there is not a strong relationship between average sentiment and bpm. Although the trend line is generally slightly positively sloped, the points are scattered pretty randomly throughout the plot, indicating no clear linear relationship between the two variables. We can conclude that bpm is not a very good predictor of average sentiment amongst 483 songs out the top 500 Rolling Stones best songs list."

    "title": "Analyzing Lyrics and Sentiment Trends from the Rolling Stones Top 500 Greatest Songs of All Time",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nMusic is a major source of entertainment that strongly influences the lives of many individuals. From the high-energy spirit of rock to the calming nature of R&B, song lyrics can reflect the values and cultural shifts of each generation. This project seeks to investigate how different lyrical themes and musical characteristics have changed across decades, uncovering patterns within some of the most iconic and memorable songs in recent history.\nDrawing from the Rolling Stone’s “500 Greatest Songs of All Time” list, we used data visualization, text analysis, and sentiment analysis to examine trends in lyrics and other musical data from the 1950s to 2000s. Our goal is to gain insight into how language has evolved over time and how these changes might relate to broader historical shifts.\nWe are interested in exploring the following 3 key research questions:\n\nHow do the sentiments of lyrics change across genres and time periods, and are sentiments related to certain characterstics of a song?\nHow do the frequencies of certain words differ across lyrics from the following three music genres: Rock (1970’s - 2000’s), Dance (1960’s - 1980’s), and Slow?\nDo certain BPMs, song durations, years, and artists appear more frequently in Rolling Stone’s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time Ranking?\n\n\n\nData Collection\nWe collected data from an online music database created by Dave Tompkins, a professor at the University of Waterloo in Canada. The initial dataset we scraped contains 7 variables:\nnumber: the number of the track artist: the artist who created the song title: the name of the song time: the length of the song bpm: the beats per minute of the song year: the year the song was released genre: the genre the song belongs to\nThe lyrics for each song were contained in another webpage linked to the original, so we iterated through and scraped the song lyrics for 485 songs (15 of the songs did not have lyrics available). It is also worth noting that a good portion (144) of the songs we are analyzing do not have a specific genre because they were labeled as “TBD” (to be determined) in the database.\n\n\nData Wrangling & Methods\nIn order to answer our research questions, we needed to wrangle our scraped data.\nWe combined the lyrics dataset with the initial dataset, resulting in a merged dataset with 11 variables, which includes the following 4 variables in addition to the 7 aforementioned variables:\ntrack: identification for each song in the database (necessary for url) track_gen: alternate version of track (also necessary for url) url: the link to the song in the online music database lyrics: the lyrics corresponding to the song\nThis dataset was then used to create additional datasets that contained the necessary variables for creating specific plots.\nTo investigate how sentiments for song lyrics changed across different time periods and genres, we created two datasets, one that included the average sentiment of lyrics of all songs released in each year and another that included the average sentiment for each genre. Additionally, we included in these datasets statistics for numerous other variables, such as each song’s average time (sec), average bpm, as well as the number of songs categorized in each year/genre. Next, to investigate whether sentiment scores were related to song length and bpm, we created a dataset that included the average sentiment by song of all 485 songs. Like the previous two datasets, this one included variables like the title, artist, year, genre, time, and bpm of each song.\nIn order to create word clouds to express word frequencies in lyrics, we combined each of the Rock decades to be one “Rock” category, rather than each individual decade. The same process was conducted for each of the Dance decades. Additional datasets were then created for each of the three genres to store word frequencies and their corresponding decades.\nFor further analysis, we created a new dataset with additional variables for the decade a song was released in and identifiers for the rankof a song—more specifically, the Top 100, 200s, and so on. We then created a subset of this dataset which contains only data for the top 3 most represented artists on the list.\n\n\nLimitations\nOne important limitation of our research is that we only analyzed song lyrics and data from 483 songs out of the top 500 Rolling Stone Greatest Songs of All Time list. There have been millions of popular songs created in recent history, so in order to more thoroughly investigate deeper trends in music lyrics and other musical metrics, we would need to obtain data from a much larger array of songs (thousands perhaps).\nAdditionally, the songs we obtained data for were released between 1953 and 2006, so our analysis does not reveal any significant changes in lyrical trends from before 1953 or after 2006. Even among the songs we analyzed, a substantial number of them were from the 1960s, while not too many were released in the 2000s. Thus, even within this time period (1953-2006), we cannot be confident that our findings reveal the true trends of music data during this era.\nFurthermore, our data does not represent the average song released throughout from the 1950s to 2000s. Our data was based on a subjective list of the best songs of all time, so it likely doesn’t represent overall trends in all music lyrics and other data. Additionally, the rock genre was overly represented in our data, consisting of more than 40% of the songs analyzed. Thus, our findings cannot be generalized to all songs as a whole, as our data was not representative of the population of songs in the first place.\n\n\nReferences\n\nRolling Stone Magazine. “The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.”\nTompkins, Dave.

    "text": "Sentiment by Year and by Genre\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown above, we created two visualizations to explore the average sentiment of song lyrics by year and by genre. Hovering over a data point or bar reveals additional information about them, such as the average time, average bpm, and number of songs included in its year/genre.\nThe line chart for the average sentiment of song lyrics ((sentiment-by-year?)) by year demonstrates the overall trends in sentiment from the 1950s to 2000s. We can see that words in song lyrics generally expressed positive sentiment, as 49 out of the 53 years had average sentiment scores greater than zero. The plot does reveal some interesting patterns that might help contextualize the shifts in artistic expression over time and the emotional climate of different years. The trend line for average sentiment seems to be slightly downward sloping over time, which can be due to many factors. For example, music genres such as heavy metal, rock, and rap have been popularized in recent times, and these genres tend to include more words with negative sentiments than other genres. Additionally, the decrease in average sentiment could have been influenced by major events that occurred in specific years. For example, the average sentiment in 2005 was slightly negative (-0.04), which could be due to the fact that Hurricane Katrina hit the United States this year, causing significant damage to the U.S. economy and costing many lives. However, it should be noted that the trend line displayed on the line chart could be skewed and biased, as the many of the points for the later years do not have many songs to use as data. Thus, the decrease in average sentiment likely does not reflect the true nature of the change in sentiment of lyrics over time.\nThe bar chart for the average sentiment of song lyrics ((sentiment-by-genre?)) by genre demonstrates the differences in overall sentiment between different genres of music. The genre called ‘TBD’ represents songs on the top 500 list that were not classified into a specific genre. We can see that genres like dance, disco, and easy generally had the most positive average sentiment scores. This reflects the positive, energetic, and uplifting natures of lyrics used in these genres. On the other hand, genres like Reggae and Slow had lower/negative sentiment scores, which makes sense as songs in these genres often evoke more solemn emotions such as calmness, peace, and melancholy. For rock music, the plot reveals that rock songs in different decades had varying average sentiments. Rock songs in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1980s had lyrics with positive sentiments (around 0.8), while those in the 1970s and 2000s had pretty low average sentiments (around 0.1). That being said, many of the genres (Dance 1970s, Disco, Easy, R&B 1980s, R&B 1990s, Reggae, Rock 2000s) had less than 10 songs included out of the 483 songs we analyzed from the top 500 list, so the data is not representative of all songs in these genres. Thus, we cannot draw too many meaningful connections regarding the actual average sentiment of song lyrics in these genres in the 2000s."

    "text": "Sentiment versus Song Time and BPM\n\nSentiment versus Song TimeSentiment versus BPM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two scatterplots above demonstrate the relationship between sentiment and two variables: song time and beats per minute (bpm). The points (songs) are also colored by their respective genres. Just like the previous plots, hovering over a data point or bar provides a dropdown with more information about the song, such as its title and artist.\nThe plot for average sentiment versus song time reveals that there is not a well-defined relationship between the two variables. The trend line is generally slightly negatively sloped, which could be an indicator that average sentiment decreases as song time increases. However, this is a very weak relationship that is likely skewed by the few very long songs (over 600 seconds) that have relatively low average sentiments. Thus, it doesn’t seem like song time is a good predictor of average sentiment.\nThe second scatterplot also reveals that there is not a strong relationship between average sentiment and bpm. Although the trend line is generally slightly positively sloped, the points are scattered pretty randomly throughout the plot, indicating no clear linear relationship between the two variables. We can conclude that bpm is not a very good predictor of average sentiment amongst 483 songs out the top 500 Rolling Stones best songs list."

    "text": "Let’s take a look at how the decades shape up compared to one another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The above segmented bar chart shows the distribution across decades of Rolling Stone Magazine’s Top 500 Songs of All Time from 2013. The colors of the segments show where on the list to find songs from a particular decade.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove, Figure 2 shows the distribution of the decades represented in Rolling Stone Magazine’s Top 500 Songs of All Time. In this, we can see that the 1960s are the clear leader in terms of representation on the list. In fact, roughly 35% of the songs on the list are from the 60s. The 70s follow at around 25%, and the 50s, 80s, and 90s each represent around 10-13% of the list. For more information on this breakdown, see Table 1. There is a clear trend downward from the 60s to the 2000s, with the 2000s being the least represented decade.\nTaking a closer look at where the songs fall in the ranking categories, i.e., Top 100, 200s, and so on, we can see that the 1960s have the most songs in the top 100 among all decades. However, this likely follows from 60s songs’ representation in the list. Interestingly, even though the 70s have many more songs on the list than the 50s, the 50s have slightly more songs in the Top 100.\n\n\nWhile all the artists on this list are well-deserving of their flowers, there are three artists who stand out among the rest. Combined, these three artists make up nearly 10% (Table 2) of the songs on the list. These artists are, of course, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and Bob Dylan.\n\nTop ArtistsTop Sentiments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The segmented bar chart above shows the number of songs each of the top three most represented artists has on the list. The segments show the decade of release of these artists’ songs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Top Artist Sentiments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor music lovers and Rolling Stone Magazine subscription-holders, it will come as little surprise that the top 3 artists represented in Rolling Stone’s Top 500 are, in order, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and Bob Dylan. The Top Artists chart above demonstrates the margin by which The Beatles’ songs outnumber the other two. The Beatles have a stunning 23 songs on the list—24 if you include John Lennon’s Imagine. The top ranking song from the supergroup is Hey Jude which ranks at 8 on the list. The Rolling Stones follow The Beatles with 14 songs, their first on the list, Satisfaction, at slot 2. Finally, Bob Dylan’s first feature of his 12 total on the list takes the number 1 slot, and that song is Like a Rolling Stone.\nWith the magazine, top artists and, songs in mind, you may have noticed a theme among their names. The number one song on the chart, one of the top three artists, and the magazine itself all contain some form of the words “Rollin’ Stone.” The is no coincidence, the band The Rolling Stones, who debuted in 1962, and Bob Dylan’s song Like a Rolling Stone (1965) are both named for the Muddy Waters song Rollin’ Stone (1950) which is actually among the top 500, ranking in at a surprising 459. The magazine is, with the additional influence of the proverb “a rolling stone gathers no moss,” named for all three of these astounding feats in music history.\nThe songwriting duo in the Beatles, John Lennon and Paul McCartney, known together as Lennon-McCartney wrote many hit songs in the 1960s (Figure 3). Though the songs they wrote for the Beatles were almost always credited to both the young gentlemen, songs written by Paul McCartney were notably more positive. Looking at Figure 4, we can see that the Beatles songs in the Top 500 tended to have a more positive sentiment, 0.83 on the AFINN’s -5 to 5 scale. For reference, Bob Dylan’s average song sentiment is around 0.035 and The Rolling Stones around -0.22. This coupled with the fact that the highest ranking Beatles song on the list is Hey Jude—a song written by Paul McCartney for Julian Lennon, John’s son—suggests that Paul McCartney might be the primary songwriter for more of the songs on the list than John Lennon.\n\n\n\nThe following tables are here to support your understanding of the above analyses and substantiate the numbers, percentages, and claims made in the text.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Decades\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSongs on List by Decade\n\n\nDecade\n\nMetrics\n\n\n\nCount\nPercent\n\n\n\n\n1950s\n55\n11.0\n\n\n1960s\n174\n34.8\n\n\n1970s\n123\n24.6\n\n\n1980s\n66\n13.2\n\n\n1990s\n54\n10.8\n\n\n2000s\n28\n5.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the Title implies, this supplemental Table 1 breaks down the number of songs the percentage of the total songs each decade holds.\n~~~~\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Artists\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSongs on List by Artist\n\n\nArtist\n\nMetrics\n\n\n\nCount\nPercent\n\n\n\n\nBob Dylan\n12\n2.4\n\n\nThe Beatles\n23\n4.6\n\n\nThe Rolling Stones\n14\n2.8\n\n\nTotal\n49\n9.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n~~~\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Top Ten\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      The Top Ten\n    \n    \n    \n      Rank\n      \n        Song Identifier\n      \n      \n        Release\n      \n    \n    \n      Artist\n      Title\n      Year\n      Decade\n    \n  \n  \n    1\nBob Dylan\nLike a Rolling Stone\n1965\n1960s\n    2\nThe Rolling Stones\nSatisfaction\n1985\n1980s\n    3\nJohn Lennon\nImagine\n1971\n1970s\n    4\nMarvin Gaye\nWhat's Going On\n1971\n1970s\n    5\nAretha Franklin\nRespect\n1967\n1960s\n    6\nThe Beach Boys\nGood Vibrations\n1966\n1960s\n    7\nChuck Berry\nJohnny B.
