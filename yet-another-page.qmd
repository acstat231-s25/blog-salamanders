# The 1960s were a Great Decade for Music 

The famous, sometimes infamous, <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine published its very first issue on November 9th, 1967. On the cover of the first volume of the magazine, John Lennon---one of four British Beatles---appears in a still shot from his role in the film <i>How I Won the War</i>. While the first Top 500 list was not released until 2003, <i>Rolling Stone</i> has set the tone for music journalism from their first issue to this very moment.

Above, @fig-decade shows the distribution of the decades represented in <i>Rolling Stone</i> Magazine's Top 500 Songs of All Time. In this, we can see that the 1960s are the clear leader in terms of representation on the list. In fact, roughly 35% of the songs on the list are from the 60s. The 70s follow at around 25%, and the 50s, 80s, and 90s each represent around 10-13% of the list. For more information on this breakdown, see @tbl-dec. There is a clear trend downward from the 60s to the 2000s, with the 2000s being the least represented decade. 
 
Taking a closer look at where the songs fall in the ranking categories, i.e., Top 100, 200s, and so on, we can see that the 1960s have the most songs in the top 100 among all decades. However, this likely follows from 60s songs' representation in the list. Interestingly, even though the 70s have many more songs on the list than the 50s, the 50s have slightly more songs in the Top 100. 
 
 
### Rolling Stone's Top Three Artists

While all the artists on this list are well-deserving of their flowers, there are three artists who stand out among the rest. Combined, these three artists make up nearly 10% (@tbl-artists) of the songs on the list. These artists are, of course, <b>The Beatles</b>, <b>The Rolling Stones</b>, and <b>Bob Dylan</b>.

For music lovers and <i>Rolling Stone</i> Magazine subscription-holders, it will come as little surprise that the top 3 artists represented in Rolling Stone's Top 500 are, in order, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and Bob Dylan. The Top Artists chart above demonstrates the margin by which The Beatles' songs outnumber the other two. The Beatles have a stunning 23 songs on the list---24 if you include John Lennon's <i>Imagine</i>. The top ranking song from the supergroup is <i>Hey Jude</i> which ranks at 8 on the list. The Rolling Stones follow The Beatles with 14 songs, their first on the list, <i>Satisfaction</i>, at slot 2. Finally, Bob Dylan's first feature of his 12 total on the list takes the number 1 slot, and that song is <i>Like a Rolling Stone</i>. 

With the magazine, top artists and, songs in mind, you may have noticed a theme among their names. The number one song on the chart, one of the top three artists, and the magazine itself all contain some form of the words "Rollin' Stone." The is no coincidence, the band The Rolling Stones, who debuted in 1962, and Bob Dylan's song <i>Like a Rolling Stone</i> (1965) are both named for the Muddy Waters song <i>Rollin' Stone</i> (1950) which is actually among the top 500, ranking in at a surprising 459. The magazine is, with the additional influence of the proverb "a rolling stone gathers no moss," named for all three of these astounding feats in music history.
