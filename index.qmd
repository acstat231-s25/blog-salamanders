abstract: "Music is an essential part of many peoples' lives. In this project, we utilize text analysis, sentiment analysis, and data visualization to explore trends in musical lyrics and more from the 1950s to 2000s. By exploring lyrics across decades and genres, we aim to uncover how language, emotion, and musical structure have evolved over time."

# Introduction

Music is a major source of entertainment that strongly influences the lives of many individuals. From the high-energy spirit of rock to the calming nature of R&B, song lyrics can reflect the values and cultural shifts of each generation. This project seeks to investigate how different lyrical themes and musical characteristics have changed across decades, uncovering patterns within some of the most iconic and memorable songs in recent history. 

Drawing from the Rolling Stone's "500 Greatest Songs of All Time" list, we used data visualization, text analysis, and sentiment analysis to examine trends in lyrics and other musical data from the 1950s to 2000s. Our goal is to gain insight into how language has evolved over time and how these changes might relate to broader historical shifts.

The following subpages display our findings:

1. [Sentiment Analysis](another-page.qmd) investigates the sentiments of lyrics, how they change across genres and time periods, and how sentiments related to certain characterstics of a song.
2. [Word Frequencies](thirdpage.qmd) relays the frequencies of certain words across lyrics from the following three music genres: Rock (1970's - 2000's), Dance (1960's - 1980's), and Slow.
3. [Top Artists](yes-another-page.qmd) examines if years or artists appear more frequently in Rolling Stoneâ€™s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time Ranking.

# Data Collection

On April 14th, 2025, we scraped our data from an online music database created by Dave Tompkins (@tompkins), a professor at the University of Waterloo in Canada. The initial dataset we scraped contains 7 variables:

`number`: the number of the track
<br>`artist`: the artist who created the song 
<br>`title`: the name of the song
<br>`time`: the length of the song
<br>`bpm`: the beats per minute of the song
<br>`year`: the year the song was released
<br>`genre`: the genre the song belongs to

The lyrics for each song were each contained in a separate webpage linked to the original, so we iterated through and scraped the song lyrics for 485 songs (15 of the songs did not have lyrics available). It is also worth noting that a good portion (144) of the songs we are analyzing do not have a specific genre because they were labeled as "TBD" (to be determined) in the database.

# Data Wrangling & Methods

In order to answer our research questions, we needed to wrangle our scraped data. 

We combined the lyrics dataset with the initial dataset, resulting in a merged dataset with 11 variables, which includes the following 4 variables in addition to the 7 aforementioned variables:

`track`: identification for each song in the database (necessary for url)
<br>`track_gen`: alternate version of `track` (also necessary for url)
<br>`url`: the link to the song in the online music database
<br>`lyrics`: the lyrics corresponding to the song

This dataset was then used to create additional datasets that contained the necessary variables for creating specific plots. 

To investigate how sentiments for song lyrics changed across different time periods and genres, we created two datasets, one that included the average sentiment of lyrics of all songs released in each year and another that included the average sentiment for each genre. Additionally, we included in these datasets statistics for numerous other variables, such as each song's average time (sec), average bpm, as well as the number of songs categorized in each year/genre. Next, to investigate whether sentiment scores were related to song length and bpm, we created a dataset that included the average sentiment by song of all 485 songs. Like the previous two datasets, this one included variables like the title, artist, year, genre, time, and bpm of each song.

In order to create word clouds to express word frequencies in lyrics, we combined each of the Rock decades to be one "Rock" category, rather than each individual decade. The same process was conducted for each of the Dance decades. Additional datasets were then created for each of the three genres to store word frequencies and their corresponding decades. 

For further analysis, we created a new dataset with additional variables for the `decade` a song was released in and identifiers for the `rank`of a song---more specifically, the Top 100, 200s, and so on. We then created a subset of this dataset which contains only data for the top 3 most represented artists on the list. 

# Tools

We used a variety of RStudio packages throughout the completion of our project. Those that were unique to the creation of a certain subpage are referenced on said page, and the commonly used packages are the following:

<b>tidyverse</b>: includes numerous core packages used in R, including `ggplot2` and `readr` (@tidyverse)
<br> <b>knitr</b>: allows us to execute code and output results (@knitr)

# Limitations

Despite our findings being applicable to anyone with an interest in music, which is an incredibly broad population, one important limitation of our research is that we only analyzed song lyrics and data from 483 songs out of the top 500 Rolling Stone Greatest Songs of All Time list. There have been millions of popular songs created in recent history, so in order to more thoroughly investigate deeper trends in music lyrics and other musical metrics, we would need to obtain data from a much larger array of songs (thousands perhaps).

Additionally, this particular iteration of the list was released in 2013, and there have been many updates to the list since then. The songs we obtained data for were released between 1953 and 2006, so our analysis does not reveal any significant changes in lyrical trends from before 1953 or after 2006. Even among the songs we analyzed, a substantial number of them were from the 1960s, while not too many were released in the 2000s. Thus, even within this time period (1953-2006), we cannot be confident that our findings reveal the true trends of music data during this era.

Furthermore, our data does not represent the average song released throughout from the 1950s to 2000s. Our data was based on a subjective list of the best songs of all time, so it likely doesn't represent overall trends in all music lyrics and other data. Additionally, the rock genre was overly represented in our data, consisting of more than 40% of the songs analyzed. Thus, our findings cannot be generalized to all songs as a whole, as our data was not representative of the population of songs in the first place. In order to diminish this subjectivity in and improve our study in the future, we could scrape data from multiple sources with the "best" songs to gather a variety of information and subjective rankings. We could also potentially steer away from the rankings and just use the 500 most listened to songs, which would eliminate any possible bias from an author's opinionated ranking.
