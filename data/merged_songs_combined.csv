People call, say, ""Beware doll, you're bound to fall"" You thought they were all kiddin' you You used to laugh about Everybody that was hangin' out Now you don't talk so loud Now you don't seem so proud About having to be scrounging your next meal How does it feel How does it feel To be without a home Like a complete unknown Like a rolling stone? Ah, you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely But you know you only used to get juiced in it Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street And now you're gonna have to get used to it You say you never compromise With the mystery tramp, but now you realize He's not selling any alibis As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes And say, ""Do you want to make a deal?"" How does it feel How does it feel To be on your own With no direction home A complete unknown Like a rolling stone? Ah, you never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns When they all did tricks for you You never understood that it ain't no good You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat Ain't it hard when you discover that He really wasn't where it's at After he took from you everything he could steal? How does it feel How does it feel To have on your own With no direction home Like a complete unknown Like a rolling stone? Ah, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made Exchanging all precious gifts But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it babe You used to be so amused At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse When you ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal How does it feel Ah, how does it feel To be on your own With no direction home Like a complete unknown Like a rolling stone?"

Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that And here's an autograph for your brother, I wrote it on the Starter cap I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too? I say that shit just clownin dogg, c'mon - how fucked up is you? You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some And what's this shit about us meant to be together? That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other I really think you and your girlfriend need each other Or maybe you just need to treat her better I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin just fine If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan, Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan I just don't want you to do some crazy shit I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to Come to think about, his name was.. it was you Damn!"

We'll sit here stranded, though were all doin' our best to deny it. And Louise holds a handful of rain temptin' you to defy it. The lights flicker from the opposite loft. In this room the heat pipes just cough. The country music station plays soft, But there's nothing, really nothing, to turn off. Just Louise and her lover so entwined And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind. In the empty lot where the ladies play Blindman's bluff with the key chain, And the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the D train. We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, Ask himself if it's him or them that's insane. Louise she's all right, she's just near, She's delicate and seems like the mirror, But she just makes it all too concise and too clear That Johanna's not here. The ghost of electricity howls in the bones of her face. Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place. Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously. He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously, And when bringing her name up he speaks of her farewell kiss to me. He's sure got a lot of gall to be so useless and all, Muttering small talk at the wall while I'm in the hall. Oh, how can I explain? it's so hard to get on And these visions of Johanna, they've kept me up past the dawn. Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while. But Mona Lisa must have had the highway blues, You can tell by the way she smiles See the primitive wallflower freeze. When the jelly-faced women all sneeze, Hear the one with the mustache say jeez, I can't find my knees. Both jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule, But these visions of Johanna they make it all seem so cruel. The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him. Saying name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out And say a prayer for him. But like Louise always says, ya can't look at much can ya man As she herself prepares for him My Madonna she still has not showed, We see this empty cage now corrode, Where her cape of the stage once had flowed, The fiddler, he now steps to the road, He writes everything's been returned which was owed On the back of the fish truck that loads While my conscience explodes. The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain."
