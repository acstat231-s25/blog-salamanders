People call, say, ""Beware doll, you're bound to fall"" You thought they were all kiddin' you You used to laugh about Everybody that was hangin' out Now you don't talk so loud Now you don't seem so proud About having to be scrounging your next meal How does it feel How does it feel To be without a home Like a complete unknown Like a rolling stone? Ah, you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely But you know you only used to get juiced in it Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street And now you're gonna have to get used to it You say you never compromise With the mystery tramp, but now you realize He's not selling any alibis As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes And say, ""Do you want to make a deal?"" How does it feel How does it feel To be on your own With no direction home A complete unknown Like a rolling stone? Ah, you never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns When they all did tricks for you You never understood that it ain't no good You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat Ain't it hard when you discover that He really wasn't where it's at After he took from you everything he could steal? How does it feel How does it feel To have on your own With no direction home Like a complete unknown Like a rolling stone? Ah, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made Exchanging all precious gifts But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it babe You used to be so amused At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse When you ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal How does it feel Ah, how does it feel To be on your own With no direction home Like a complete unknown Like a rolling stone?"

Tears and fears and feeling proud, to say ""I love you"" right out loud, dreams and schemes and circus crowds, I've looked at life that way. But now old friends are acting strange, they shake their heads, they tell me that I've changed. Something's lost but something's gained in living every day. I've looked at life from both sides now, from win and lose, and still somehow it's life's illusions I recall. I really don't know life at all."

Everybody, I say it goes like this Well, I was comin' home late one dark afternoon A reporter stopped me for a interview She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables that I'm vicious on the mic and the turntables This young reporter I did adore So I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before she said damn fly guy I'm in love with you the Casanova legend must have been true I said by the way baby what's your name said I go by the name of Lois Lane and you could be my boyfriend you surely can just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman i said he's a fairy i do suppose flyin' through the air in pantyhose he may be very sexy or even cute but he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit i said you need a man who's got finesse and his whole name across his chest he may be able to fly all through the night but can he rock a party 'til the early light he cant satisfy you with his little worm but I can bust you out with my super sperm I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do

o'clock one Friday night I was rockin' to the beat and feelin' all right Everybody was dancin' on the floor Doin' all the things they never did before And then this fly fly girl with a sexy lean She came into the bar, she came into the scene As she traveled deeper inside the room All the fellas checked out her white Sasoons She came up to the table, looked into my eyes Then she turned around and shook her behind So I said to myself, it's time for me to release my vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece and now people in the house this is just for you A little rap to make you boogaloo now the group you hear is called phase two and let me tell you somethin' we're a hell of a crew Once a week we're on the street just a-cuttin' the jams and making it free For you to party you got to have the movies So we'll get right down and give you the groove For you to dance you gotta get hype So we'll get right down for you tonight Now the system's on and the girls are there You definitely have a rockin' affair But let me tell ya somethin' there's still one fact That to have a party you got to have a rap So when the party's over you're makin' it home and tryin' to sleep before the break of dawn and while ya sleepin' ya start to dream and thinkin' how ya danced on the disco scene My name appears in your mind Yeah, a name you know that was right on time It was phase two just a doin' a do Rockin' you down cause you know we could to the rhythm of the beat that makes you freak come alive girls get on your feet To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat To the double beat beat that it

come on Wonder Mike do what you like Like a can of beer that's sweeter than honey Like a millionaire that has no money Like a rainy day that is not wet Like a gamblin' fiend that does not bet Like Dracula with out his fangs Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang Like collard greens that don't taste good Like a tree that's not made out of wood Like goin' up and not comin' down is just like the beat without the sound no sound to the beat beat, you do the freak everybody just rock and dance to the beat have you ever went over a friends house to eat and the food just ain't no good I mean the macaroni's soggy the peas are mushed and the chicken tastes like wood so you try to play it off like you think you can by sayin' that you're full and then your friend says momma he's just being polite he ain't finished uh uh that's bull so your heart starts pumpin' and you think of a lie and you say that you already ate and your friend says man there's plenty of food so you pile some more on your plate while the stinky foods steamin' your mind s tarts to dreamin' of the moment that it's time to leave and then you look at your plate and your chickens slowly rottin' into something that looks like cheese oh so you say that's it i got to leave this place I don't care what these people think I'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous with this ugly food that stinks so you bust out the door while its still closed still sick from the food you ate and then you run to the store for quick relief from a bottle of kaopectate and then you call your friend two weeks later to see how he has been and he says i understand about the food baby bubbah but we're still friends with a hip hop the hippie to the hippie the hip hip a hop a you don't stop the rockin to the bang bang boogie say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie the beat I say Hank can ya rock Can you rock to the rhythm that just don't stop? Can you hip me to the shoobie doo? I said come on make the make the people move I go to the halls and then ring the bell because I am the man with the clientele And if you ask me why I rock so well a-big bang, I got clientele and from the time I was only six years old I never forgot what I was told It was the best advice that I ever had It came from my wise, dear old dad He said sit down punk I wanna talk to you and don't say a word until I'm through Now, there's a time to laugh a time to cry A time to live and a time to die A time to break and a time to chill To act civilized or act real ill But whatever you do in your lifetime You never let a MC steal your rhyme So from sixty six 'til this very day I'll always remember what he had to say So when the sucker MCs try to chump my style I let them know that I'm versatile I got style finesse and a little black book That's filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look But there's a thing that separates you from me and that's called originality because my rhymes are on from what you heard I didn't even bite and not a goddamn word and I say a little more later on tonight so the sucker MC's can bite all night a-tick a-tock y'all a-beat beat y'all a-let's rock y'all ya don't stop?

Oh yeah I need someone to show me The things in life that I can't find I can't see the things that make true happiness I must be blind Make a joke and I will sigh And you will laugh and I will cry Happiness I cannot feel And love to me is so unreal And so as you hear these words Telling you now of my state I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late
